# Webkit-based browser for the blind 

This repository contains an accessible for the  blind wrapper for [Webkit engine](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/web/WebEngine.html)  shipped with JavaFX.
It analyzes DOM structure computed inside of  Webkit core and prepares special metadata, 
which is designed to be comfortable enough for perception of blind people.
The major distinguishing of this approach from other text-based solutions (w3m, lynx, etc)
is that it supports JavaScript pretty well.
The UI for this browser is based on [LUWRAIN environment for the blind](https://github.com/luwrain/luwrain).
